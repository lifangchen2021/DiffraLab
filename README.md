## 🖥️ Quick Usage and Demonstration

Below are brief operation steps with screenshots to help you get started quickly:

### 1️⃣ BraggIt - Powder Diffraction Simulation

- Simulates powder diffraction patterns with customizable lattice parameters and wavelengths.
- Utilizes **Monte Carlo methods to generate diffraction patterns for cubic crystal systems (e.g., FCC, BCC)**.
- Supports input of different particle numbers and calculation times, with **animated visualization of the diffraction pattern generation process**, helping students understand virtual experiments and diffraction statistics.
- **Enables export of diffraction plots and 2θ-intensity data in Excel format**, allowing students to calculate peak resolution and perform Gaussian fitting analysis.
- Visualizes diffraction peaks and relative intensities to facilitate learning of Bragg's Law and the principles of powder diffraction.

### 2️⃣ ResoFox - Instrumental Resolution Calculator

- Calculates the instrumental resolution function of neutron diffractometers based on the **Caglioti model**.
- Allows adjustment of collimator divergence and monochromator parameters to **visualize FWHM variations** under different conditions.
- **Supports exporting plots for comparison of results under different parameter settings**, helping students analyze how instrument configurations affect resolution.
- The console prints **detailed theoretical calculation data**, including relative neutron intensities, theoretical diffraction angles, FWHM, and resolution values for each setting, allowing in-depth analysis and validation.
- For a **more detailed tutorial and validation results**, please refer to the following repository: [https://github.com/lifangchen2021/ResoFox](https://github.com/lifangchen2021/ResoFox)

### 3️⃣ G-Fitter - Multi-peak Gaussian Fitting

- Performs **multi-peak Gaussian fitting on simulated or experimental diffraction data**.
- Extracts peak positions and FWHM values for analysis and reporting.
- By clicking the **"Select File" button**, users can select the Excel file exported from BraggIt and **directly perform Gaussian fitting on the simulated diffraction results**.
