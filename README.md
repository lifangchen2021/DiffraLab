# DiffaLab
![DiffraLab Mascot](images/DiffraLab1.png)

A Python educational platform (DiffraLab) integrating BraggIt (Monte Carlo powder diffraction), ResoFox (instrumental resolution calculator), and G-Fitter (multi-peak Gaussian fitting) for neutron and X-ray diffraction simulation and analysis in physics education.

---

## ✨ Features

✅ **BraggIt:** Simulate powder diffraction patterns for different crystal structures and wavelength uncertainties using Monte Carlo methods.  
✅ **ResoFox:** Calculate instrumental resolution functions of neutron diffractometers based on Caglioti’s analytical model.  
✅ **G-Fitter:** Perform multi-peak Gaussian fitting on experimental or simulated diffraction data, extracting FWHM and peak centers.  
✅ **GUI-based** for direct operation without programming background, suitable for classroom demonstration and lab training.  
✅ Developed for physics and materials science education.
